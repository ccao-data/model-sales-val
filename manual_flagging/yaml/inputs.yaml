# manual_update: A boolean setting to control flag updates. If set
# to "false", it initializes a new set of flags with each assigned
# a version number of "1". If set to "true", the script increments
# the version number by 1 for existing flags in sales; for sales
# without flags, it assigns a version number of "1". The latest
# version of each sale flag can be found in the "default"."vw_pin_sale" view.

# The values in housing_market_type, run_tri, and tri_stat_groups will tell the
# sales val script which properties will be updated. The housing_market_type
# list supports 'res_single_family', 'res_multi_family', and/or 'condos'.
# The run_tri van be 1, 2, and/or 3, and the values for the tri_stat_groups
# can be "current" or "og_mansueto".

# 'tri_stat_groups' specifies which flagging methodology will be used for
# which tri

# Note: If 'og_mansueto' is selected along with either 'res_single_family' or
# 'res_multi_family', it will trigger an update for all residential property
# types ('res_single_family' and 'res_multi_family'). This behavior is
# intrinsic to the 'og_mansueto' script's functionality.
